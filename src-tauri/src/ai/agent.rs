//! Agentic tool-calling loop for the mailbox-wide chat (`ai_chat`).
//!
//! Instead of a fixed retrieve-then-answer step, the model drives its own
//! retrieval through two tools — `search_emails` and `read_email` — and we
//! stream its reasoning trace (which tool it called, with what) plus the
//! answer. Works for both providers: a provider-neutral transcript is
//! serialized to each provider's wire format before every round.
